Payment is critical topic and its handlers must be tested from all aspects. Laravel Toman has an automated test suit with 100% coverage. On every released build, we're enforced to pass all tests so you can add payment to your code with confidence.

## Elegant API

API and methods are pretty easy to use! Requesting a new payment and verifying it will add <170 characters to your code base! ðŸ˜Ž

## Supports Multiple Gateways
