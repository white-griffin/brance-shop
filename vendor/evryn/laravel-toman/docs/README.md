Payment is a critical topic, and its handlers must be tested from all aspects. Laravel Toman has an automated test suit with high coverage. On every released build, we're forced to pass all tests so you can add a payment to your code with confidence.

## Elegant API

APIs are pretty much easy to use! Requesting a new payment and verifying it will add ~10 lines to your codebase! ðŸ˜Ž

## Supports Multiple Gateways

We are planning to add new gateway providers. They'll require minimum possible changes in your code.
Currently, following gateways are available to use:  
âœ… [Zarinpal.com](https://zarinpal.com)  
âœ… [IDPay.ir](https://idpay.ir)  
ðŸ”˜ [YekPay.com](https://yekpay.com/)  
ðŸ”˜ [Pay.ir](https://pay.ir/)  
ðŸ”˜ [PayPing.ir](https://www.payping.ir/)  
ðŸ”˜ ...
